## Project Description

I currently work as a data analyst at Boho Beautiful, a company run by a digital nomad yogi family. As my first step starting my work
in this new position, I will execute a data analysis about the companies YouTube channel. 
The purpose of this project is to create data sets containing detailed information about the YouTube channel for further data analysis. 
The results of the data analysis will then be visualized and documented in a technical report. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
1. Correlation between lenght of video and views , likes, dislikes and comments 
2. Correlation between views and likes
3. Views, likes, dislikes and comments per video category

## Dataset
Wescraping & YouTube API
The data set of this analysis was acquired by using Googles Data API V3 for YouTube. I scraped a Youtube Channel and
stored the data in several dataframes for further analysis and visualizations using Tableau. The tables contain information
about the videos of the YouTube Channel, including title, ID, published time and date, views, likes, dislikes, comments
and duration of the videos. Several categories were created as sub data sets and used for categorizing, 
e.g. 10 min videos, 25 min videos, workout videos, how-to videos...

## Workflow
The first step was to figure out how to obtain data of Boho Beautifuls YouTube channel.
After that it was necessary to clean and store this data in tables, creating several categories by video types and lenghts.
Finally, the analysis is visualized in Tableau and presented in a powerpoint presentation.
For organization I used a OneNote notebook containing all links and deadlines.
