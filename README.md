As my first step starting my work in this new position, I will execute a data analysis about the companies YouTube channel. 
The purpose of this project is to create data sets containing detailed informations about the YouTube channels videos for further data analysis, with the goal of generating valuable informations for strategic business decisions.

## Questions & Hypotheses❔

Some of the areas I want to explore are the correlation between certain parameters of the videos and the videos statistics (views , likes, dislikes and comments); as well as the dispersion of statistics per video category. This can be very interesting to gain insights about what the viewers of the YouTube channel like in terms of content type or video lenghts. This information can be used for stratetig content planning and future business decisions.  
  
Questions  
1. Correlation between lenght of video and views , likes, dislikes and comments 
2. Correlation between views and likes
3. Views, likes, dislikes and comments per video category

Hypotheses
1. 

## Dataset📄

The data set for this data analysis was obtained by using Googles data API V3 for YouTube. I scraped the YouTube channels playlists and stored the information in several dataframes for further analysis and visualizations with Tableau. 
The tables contain information about the videos of the YouTube channel, including title, ID, published time and date, views, likes, dislikes, comments and duration of the videos. Several categories were created as sub datasets and then used for categorizing videos:
- 10min videos
- 15min videos
- 20min videos
- Yoga videos
- Workout videos
- Meditation videos
- Lifestyle videos
